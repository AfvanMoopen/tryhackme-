## Start finding 

When you know exactly what you’re looking for, you don’t need to search for it; you just have to find it.

This tutorial will help you understand how to use the `find` command effectively in a CTF context. It is written in a way that you won’t have to refer to the man page to complete it, although I recommend the man page for further reading.

The syntax of the command can be broken down as such:

find where what

Firstly you tell the system to find something; secondly you tell it where to look; and finally, you tell it what to look for.

You don’t need to specify when you’re looking in your working directory. Also, you can use wildcards as well, in specifying both a directory and a name.

Note: **There's no VM** to deploy in this room. You only need to enter the commands that would be used to find what the questions ask for. You can also test the commands on your own terminal (if you have access to a Unix or Unix-like system) to check the output of `find` with different options. However, that's not necessary; this is a walkthrough, and everything you need to solve this room is in the tasks' description.

On your terminal, execute the command: `touch file-1 file-2`

This command will create two files, named file-1 and file-2 respectively, in your current working directory.

Now, execute: `find file*`

As you can see, the command outputs both of your files.

This time, execute: `find *1`

Only file-1 is in the output.

These commands are useful when you want to specify only part of the name of what you’re looking for.

## Be more specific

Most of the time, you won’t be looking for something in your working directory. The first argument of your `find` command should be the directory you want to search. The command will search in that directory and in all its subdirectories. So, if you want to search the whole filesystem, your command should begin with `find /`.

Two very useful flags are the `-type` and `-name` flags. With `-type`, you can use `d` to only find directories, and `f` to only find files. The `-name` flag is used to specify a name or pattern to look for. You can type the whole name, or use wildcards to specify only part(s) of the name. If you use wildcards, you need to enclose your pattern in quotes, otherwise the command won't work as intended. It is useful to know that you can also use the `-iname` flag; same as `-name`, but case insensitive.

1. Find all files whose name ends with ".xml"

    ```bash
    find / -type f -name "*.xml"
    ```

2. Find all files in the /home directory (recursive) whose name is "user.txt" (case insensitive)

    ```bash
    find /home -type f -iname user.txt
    ```

3. Find all directories whose name contains the word "exploits"

    ```bash
    find / -type d -name "*exploits*"
    ```

## Know exactly what you're looking for

In some situations, specifying just the name of a file will not be enough. You can also specify the owner, the size, the permissions, and the time the file was last accessed/modified as well.

The username of the **owner** of a file is specified with the `-user` flag.

The **size** of a file is specified with the `-size` flag. When using numerical values, the formats `-n`, `+n`, and `n` can be used, where n is a number. `-n` matches values lesser than `n`, `+n` matches values greater than `n`, and `n` matches values exactly `n`. To specify a size, you also need a suffix. `c` is the suffix for **bytes**, `k` for **KiB’s**, and `M` for **MiB’s**. So, if you want to specify a size less than 30 bytes, the argument `-30c` should be used.

The `-perm` flag is used to specify **permissions**, either in octal form (ex. `644`) or in symbolic form (ex. `u=r`). See [here](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/linux-pocket-guide/9780596806347/re44.html) for a short reference. If you specify the permission mode as shown above (ex. `644` or `u=r`), then `find` will only return files with those permissions **exactly**. You can use the `–` or `/` prefix to make your search more inclusive. Using the `–` prefix will return files with **at least** the permissions you specify; this means that the `-444` mode will match files that are readable by **everyone**, even if someone also has write and/or execute permissions. Using the `/` prefix will return files that match **any** of the permissions you have set; this means that the `/666` mode will match files that are readable and writeable by **at least one** of the groups (owner, group, or others).

Lastly, **time-related** searches will be covered. These are more complex but may prove useful. The flag consists of a word and a prefix. The words are `min` and `time`, for minutes and days, respectively. The prefixes are `a`, `m`, and `c`, and are used to specify when a file was last **accessed**, **modified**, or had its status **changed**. As for the numerical values, the same rules of the `-size` flag apply, except there is no suffix. To put it all together: in order to specify that a file was last accessed more than 30 minutes ago, the option `-amin +30` is used. To specify that it was modified less than 7 days ago, the option `-mtime -7` is used. (Note: when you want to specify that a file was modified within the last 24 hours, the option `-mtime 0` is used.)

1. Find all files owned by the user "kittycat"

    ```bash
    find / -type f -user kittycat
    ```

2. Find all files that are exactly 150 bytes in size

    ```bash
    find / -type f -size 150c
    ```

3. Find all files in the /home directory (recursive) with size less than 2 KiB’s and extension ".txt"

    ```bash
    find /home -type f -size -2k -name "*.txt"
    ```

4.  Find all files that are exactly readable and writeable by the owner, and readable by everyone else (use octal format)
    
    ```bash
    find / -type f -perm 644
    ```

5.  Find all files that are only readable by anyone (use octal format)

    ```bash
    find / -type f -perm /444
    ```

6.  Find all files with write permission for the group "others", regardless of any other permissions, with extension ".sh" (use symbolic format)

    ```bash
    find / -type f -perm g=w -name "*.sh"
    ```

7. Find all files in the /usr/bin directory (recursive) that are owned by root and have at least the SUID permission (use symbolic format)

    ```bash
    find /usr/bin -type f -user root -perm u=s
    ```

8. Find all files that were not accessed in the last 10 days with extension ".png"

    ```bash
    find / -type f -atime +10 -name "*.png"
    ```

9. Find all files in the /usr/bin directory (recursive) that have been modified within the last 2 hours

    ```bash
    find /usr/bin -type f -mmin +120
    ```
## Have you found it? 

To conclude this tutorial, there are two more things that you should know of. The first is that you can use the redirection operator `>` with the `find` command. You can save the results of the search to a file, and more importantly, you can suppress the output of any possible errors to make the output more readable. This is done by appending `2> /dev/null` to your command. This way, you won’t see any results you’re not allowed to access.

The second thing is the `-exec` flag. You can use it in your `find` command to execute a new command, following the `-exec` flag, like so: `-exec whoami \;`. The possibilities enabled by this option are beyond the scope of this tutorial, but most notably it can be used for privilege escalation.

1.  You are now better equipped to find anything you’re looking for in a filesystem.
